Creates a web2nl config file by extracting relevant elements from an existing web2nl model, and converting them to JSON format. 
The resulting config file can be uploaded into Model Workbench and used in place of the MWB Default Config file.

This allows us to onboard existing models into MWB, so that transforms don't need to be entered one by one into the MWB "Create Transform" interface.
